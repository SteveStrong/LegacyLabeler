Voice-Assisted Document Triage Application
Proposal for Technical Drawing Cataloging Initiative
Date: January 12, 2026
Prepared For: Document Library Stakeholders
Purpose: Unlock 2,567 unusable technical drawings through efficient SME review
Executive Summary
The Problem: You have 2,567 technical drawings (CAD drawings, scanned mechanicals) sitting in unnamed, unsearchable states across multiple storage locations.
These documents represent significant organizational knowledge but are effectively unusable because no one can find what they need.
The Blocker: These documents require Subject Matter Expert (SME) review to identify and describe. Traditional approaches (manual typing into spreadsheets) are too
time-consuming to be practical. As a result, the documents remain in limbo.
Our Proposal: Build a simple voice-assisted triage application that runs on any laptop and enables SMEs to efficiently review and describe documents in
approximately 1 minute per document instead of 5-10 minutes with manual data entry.
The Outcome:
2,567 documents properly named and cataloged
Searchable text descriptions enabling document discovery
Foundation for future AI/RAG initiatives
Task becomes actually completable (vs. staying in limbo forever)
Why This Makes Sense: Voice is 5x faster than typing. A simple tool turns an impossible task into a manageable project that multiple SMEs can complete in parallel.
Current State Assessment
Document Inventory
993 PDF drawings on server - unnamed files awaiting review
1,574 scanned mechanical drawings on external hard drive - require naming and classification
Total: 2,567 documents effectively locked away from users
Why They're Unusable
1. No meaningful filenames - "Drawing_347.pdf" tells you nothing
2. No metadata - Can't search, can't categorize, can't find
3. No organization - Not structured for SharePoint or document management systems
4. SME knowledge required - Only experts can identify what these documents represent
Current Workflow Limitations
Without intervention, the options are:
Option A: Manual Spreadsheet Entry
SME opens each drawing
Switches to Excel
Types description, categories, keywords
Reality: Too slow and tedious; task never gets completed
Option B: Do Nothing
Documents remain unnamed
SharePoint migration blocked
Engineers continue wasting time hunting for files
Knowledge lost when SMEs retire
Neither option is acceptable.
Proposed Solution: Simple Voice Triage Application
Core Concept
Create a simple desktop application that runs on any laptop and makes document review fast and natural for SMEs by leveraging voice input instead of typing.
Not specialized hardware. Just a straightforward app that anyone can use on their existing computer.
How It Works
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: VIEW │
│ Drawing automatically displays on screen │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 2: SPEAK │
│ SME presses spacebar and describes the document: │
│ "This is the Unit 2 cooling water pump assembly, │
│ revision C, shows motor mount and piping │
│ connections, dated 2023" │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 3: TRANSCRIBE (Local) │
│ System transcribes speech to text │
│ • Uses local speech-to-text (no external calls) │
│ • Transcription happens on the laptop │
│ • Text saved to local database │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 4: REVIEW & SAVE │
│ SME reviews transcribed text │
│ Makes any edits if needed │
│ Clicks "Save & Next" │
│ • Document metadata saved locally │
│ • File renamed according to convention │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 5: NORMALIZE (Optional Background) │
│ Periodically, AI can normalize descriptions: │
│ • Standardize terminology across all documents │
│ • Fix inconsistent formatting │
│ • Extract keywords and categories │
│ • This happens offline as batch process │
│ • Not required for core functionality │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
TIME PER DOCUMENT: About 1 minute (vs. 5-10 min manually)
